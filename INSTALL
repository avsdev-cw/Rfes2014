Pre-requisites
---------------
- [R v3.4.0+](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [netCDF4](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c) (see known issues in README.md)

How to install
---------------
When installing on a system with netCDF installed in a normal location (ie /usr) then all that is required is:
```
# From the directory above Rfes2014
R CMD INSTALL Rfes2014
```

To build & install when netCDF installed elsewhere (eg `/opt/netcdf4`):
```
export NETCDF_PATH=/opt/netcdf4 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${NETCDF_PATH}/lib R CMD INSTALL Rfes2014
```
To use the package when netCDF is installed elsewhere, remember to use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when calling R:
```
NETCDF_PATH=/opt/netcdf4 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${NETCDF_PATH}/lib R
```
If you're using Windows: fend for yourself!
